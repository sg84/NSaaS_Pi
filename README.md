#CloudGuard Connect Demo with Raspberry Pi


> First up - enable the SSH server as on Raspbian as it's not enabled by default. 

	sudo raspi-config. Then choose the option to enable SSH server.

> If you don't have access to this, you can mount the SD card in another machine and add a file named 'ssh' in the /boot folder.

> Connect wired ethernet, make sure you receive an IP address on eth0 and have internet access. Then update APT

	sudo apt update

> Install packages required. DNSmasq is a DNS forwarder and DHCP server. HostAP is a driver that allows the wireless card to run in HostAP mode. StrongSwan is an open-source IPsec solution.
	
	sudo apt install strongswan hostapd dnsmasq

> Stop the newly installed DNS and DHCP services as they're not configured yet.

	sudo systemctl stop dnsmasq
	sudo systemctl stop hostapd
	
> Configure the DHCP file and make a note of the range. This will be used later in the VPN configuration.
	
	sudo nano /etc/dhcpcd.conf

> Add the following to the end of the file to configure your wireless card

    interface wlan0
	static ip_address=192.168.200.1/24
	nohook wpa_supplicant

> Disable IPv6 (this makes things complicated)

    sudo nano /etc/sysctl.conf
    
> Add the following lines to the end of the file
    net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6 = 1
    net.ipv6.conf.default.disable_ipv6 = 1
    net.ipv6.conf.lo.disable_ipv6 = 1

> Make these changes active

    sudo sysctl -p
    
> Restart the DHCP service

	sudo service dhcpcd restart
	
> Take a backup of the DNSmasq config and create a new one

	sudo mv /etc/dnsmasq.conf /etc/dnsmasq.conf.orig
	sudo nano /etc/dnsmasq.conf
	
> Add the following to the new /etc/dnsmasq.conf file

    interface=wlan0
    dhcp-range=192.168.200.2,192.168.200.100,24h

> Restart dnsmasq

	sudo systemctl reload dnsmasq

> Configure the wireless AP settings

	sudo nano /etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf

> Add the following (you should be able to pick out the relevant parts to change for PSK and SSID values if you want to change yet)

    interface=wlan0
    hw_mode=g
    driver=nl80211
    ssid=CheckPoint_NSaaS
    channel=11
    wmm_enabled=0
    macaddr_acl=0
    auth_algs=1
    ignore_broadcast_ssid=0
    wpa=2
    wpa_passphrase=Cpwins1!
    wpa_pairwise=TKIP
    rsn_pairwise=CCMP

> Next, configure the OS to know that this is the config file to use for hostapd. Edit the file /etc/default/hostapd

	sudo nano /etc/default/hostapd

> Find the section starting #DAEMON_CONF. Add the line below:

    DAEMON_CONF="/etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf"

> Enable and start our new services

	sudo systemctl unmask hostapd
	sudo systemctl enable hostapd
	sudo systemctl start hostapd
	sudo systemctl enable dnsmasq
	
> At this point, we should have an SSID being broadcast and DNS / DHCP services ready to go. You'll be able to connect to the SSID at this point but you won't have internet access.

> Enable IP forwarding.

	sudo nano /etc/sysctl.conf
		
> Uncomment the line
	
    net.ipv4.ip_forward=1

> As we're using a VPN, we'll need to add a couple of rules to 'mangle' the MTU and MSS values.
	
	sudo iptables -t mangle -A FORWARD -m policy --pol ipsec --dir in -p tcp -m tcp --tcp-flags SYN,RST SYN -m tcpmss --mss 1361:1536 -j TCPMSS --set-mss 1360
	sudo iptables -t mangle -A FORWARD -m policy --pol ipsec --dir out -p tcp -m tcp --tcp-flags SYN,RST SYN -m tcpmss --mss 1361:1536 -j TCPMSS --set-mss 1360

> Save the IPtables policy

	sudo iptables-save | sudo tee /etc/iptables.ipsec_rules
	
> Make sure these settings are loaded every time the Pi reboots. Also make sure PMTU discovery is disabled. Edit the file /etc/rc.local and these lines above 'exit 0':

    iptables-restore < /etc/iptables.ipsec_rules
    echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_no_pmtu_disc
    ifconfig eth0 mtu 1400 up
    ipsec stop
    ipsec start

> That's the OS configured - now we can configure our IPsec settings. From the zip / GIT repo copy the files to the following locations:

    60-trigger_api.sh -> /home/
    ipsec.conf -> /etc/
    ipsec.secrets -> /etc/
    ip_update.py -> /home/

> Create a DHCPCD exit hook to trigger the API update script anytime the ethernet port is replugged or ip is updated.
    sudo cp /home/60-trigger_api.sh /etc/dhcpcd.exit-hook
    sudo chmod +x /etc/dhcpcd.exit-hook

> Create a cronjob to restart the VPN every 30 mins (seems to be a stability issue with Strongswan - looking into this).

    sudo touch current_cron    
    sudo crontab -l | sudo tee current_cron
    echo â€œ*/30 * * * * ipsec stop; ipsec start" | sudo tee current_cron
    sudo crontab current_cron

    
> At this point, you'll need to have access to the NSaaS portal and have a site setup.
> Create your site and make a note of the name (IMPORTANT - make sure it's a unique name - the portal allows duplicates!), PSK and cloud gw address. Make sure the internal network matches the wifi DHCP range you've setup on the Pi.
> In the portal - go to global settings and create an API key for NSaaS. Copy out the client ID and secret key, you'll need to add these to the Python script ip_update.
> While you're here - go to the site you want to connect to and copy out the exact site name - you'll need this later.

> Now you've got the keys, add them to the ip_update.py file and make sure everything in the #connection info section is completed.

> Next edit /etc/ipsec.conf. There are two sections to focus on, conn local-connections and conn local-to-cgnsaas.
> In local-connections, make sure leftsubnet and rightsubnet are set to be the network for the WIFI. This section prevents local traffic being forced over the VPN
> In local-to-cgnsaas configure the following properties:
    
    right= This should be the FQDN you get from the NSaaS portal that you connect TO. You're given two by NSaaS, pick the first one only. For this demo, we don't need two tunnels.
    leftsubnet= This should be set to your local WIFI network (which will match what you configured for the network on the NSaaS side).

> Next, edit /etc/ipsec.secrets. This is the file that maps a site address / FQDN to a PSK. You'll want a line that looks like the below (but use the details from the portal for your site)...

    g-1183-f26476d972d0fb1d6552a6f4b0bb9c8b.checkpoint.cloud : PSK "6NCXCVXCVogD7Ky4vXwc8bhBTUJoODFczyA"
    
> You're done! Reboot the Pi and then when the wired interface comes up the following will happen:
    
    1. The interface up / down script fires
    2. ip_update.py file is executed - checking your external IP and then sending that to NSaaS via API.
    3. When site is updated - the IPSEC services are restarted and the VPN tunnel comes up.
    4. You can connect clients to the CheckPoint_NSaaS SSID and view the logs in the portal.
    
>> To verify IPSEC connectivity you can run
    
    sudo ipsec statusall
    
>> The output should show "Security Associations (1 up) and then INSTALLED shortly after.
